            <h1>Who is Foo?</h1>
            Foo is a chihuahua from Houston, Texas. 
            Foo was found at a young age by the Rodriguez family near a local park. 
            The puppy, after hours, only responded to Andre calling him by the name Foo. 
            The family decided to take the puppy in as one of their own and he
            quickly won over the family, establishing himself as an intelligent and charismatic puppy.
            He went on to provide companionship and serve as inspiration for the family to this day, although he recently retired his gig as a mentor.
